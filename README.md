- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Kelley and I hail from northeast Ohio. I have lived right outside of Cleveland for 20 years.  I am currently a bank examiner specializing in consumer compliance laws and regulations.  Throughout my career, I have also had the opportunity to work with various data sources, including the Federal Financial Institutions Council's Census Flat files (https://www.ffiec.gov/censusapp.htm), the Census Data sets themselves, Current Employment Statistics from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statics (https://www.bls.gov/ces/), quarterly bank Call Report data (https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/ManageFacsimiles.aspx), and the Interagency Loan Data Request (https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1305.htm).
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning coding. My Excel knowledge is great and I have had experience with using SQL but I want to expand my knowledge base. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking a Data Analytics Boot Camp course through Ohio State.  We have covered Excel, Microsoft Visual Basic, Python (including dataframes, Jupyter Notebooks, Matplotlib, and Application Programming Interfaces), SQL (including SQLite), basic HTML, and JavaScript.  We will be exploring Tableau, R, and machine learning.
